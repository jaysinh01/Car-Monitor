   - Car: Provide a list of all the turns; Provide duration and arrival time; Provide all the turns and how long
   to remain on the road
   - Bus: Provide arrival stop and departure stop, provide walking direction to the stops, Provide what to take; etc.

  Weather:
   - Upon entering city and country it will find the weather including wind and chances of precipitation of desired city

  Stocks:
   - Once user enters ticker symbol it will provide the current state of stock price
   - If user requests more information, it will display a graph of depicting fluctuations in stocks (5 days)

  Music:
   - Music will display all the music listed in the specified folder.
   - User will either have a choice of choosing one or choosing all (shuffled and in order)


 Milestones:

 By November 19th:
   - Use google API to find directions from starting point to destination.
   - Google API will generate output in JSON and python will extract the desired data from the file
   - Figure out sending requests and extracting specific data from the JSON file
 By November 26th:
   - Screen Scrap or use weather API to output weather of the desired city
   - Display list of music and depending on the selection use VLC library to play the user choice
   - Having the Ticker symbol find the corresponding stock
 By December 3rd:
   - Implement all the features on GUI

 Bonus Milestones:
   - Use buttons connected to MegaController to control the GUI

 Question:
