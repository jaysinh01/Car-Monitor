CMPUT 274 Final Project: Car Monitor/Dashboard
Names: Ang Li and Jaysinh Parmar
Student_ID: ___________ and 1532143
CCID: _____________ and Jaysinh Parmar

The car monitor has three features:

	Weather:
		Find out current weather along with local time of any desired city
	Music
		Put music in the folder called static and the file will be displayed on the server. You may chose
		to autoplay or select you own music. It also has an option of sorting the music by preference. In other words,
		the music you play the most will be featured at top of the list.
	Maps:
		Maps has two parts:
			Nearby:
				Once you click nearby you will be prompted diffrent catogories. Upon clicking one of them,
				you will notice list of places satisfying the catogory one clicked on. The list is a list
				of places near current location (based on IP). Sorting of the list is done based on prominance
				(gobal popularity, google's index and other factor)*. Once you make a select a place, it will
				show you step by step directions to the place.
			Directions:
				Enter the destination you would like to visit. It will then search the place and suggest a
				valid address. If that is the address you desire, make the selection and it will display
				step by step direction to the destination.
			The maps has multiple internal features such as storing directions to the place under direction folder and 
			writing history of the searches.
			Storing navigation data would potentially kill the latency caused in calling the API and also reduce the
			usage of API. Storing search was initially being used for a feature however we were not able to implement
			it on the server and is currently being used for debugging purpose.
